# Quant-Intern---Follow-Up-Assignment

## Overview
  This folder consists of two directories and several code files. All the codes are written in Python 3. The description of folders and files are as follows:
   - *fake_files/* : the directory to store fake files.
   - *floppy_disks/* : the directory where floppy disks locate.
   - src.py: python script including all the functions used.
   - run.py: python script used to generate and copy files.
   - run.ipynb: jupyter notebook used to generate and copy files (if Anaconda is installed).
## Required Libraries
  Here is the list of libraries used in this project:
  1. Numpy;
  2. shutil;
  3. os;
  4. matplotlib.

## How to Use
  1. Delete existing files in ***fake_files/*** directory and all sub-directories in ***floppy_disks/*** directory;
  2. Run the Python script ***run.py*** to implement the file generation and backup process. If Anaconda has been installed, ***run.ipynb*** can be used to run in order to display outcomes step by step.
